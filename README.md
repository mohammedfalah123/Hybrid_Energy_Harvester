# Hybrid_Energy_Harvester
The code simulates and optimizes a hybrid energy harvester combining piezoelectric, thermoelectric, and solar modules. Each source is modeled with realistic physics, then merged into total power output. A unified objective balances efficiency and stability. Four algorithms (PSO, DE, GA, Hybrid) are compared, with Hybrid achieving best results.

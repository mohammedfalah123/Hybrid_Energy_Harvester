Innovator:Mohammed Falah Hassan Al-Dhafiri

Hybrid energy harvesting system using PSO, DE, and GA with advanced smoothing for efficiency and stability.

Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a hybrid energy harvesting system that integrates piezoelectric, thermoelectric, and solar modules. The system applies hybrid optimization algorithms (PSO, DE, GA, and their combinations) with advanced smoothing techniques to maximize efficiency and stability under realistic physical constraints.

Features
- Multi-source energy harvesting: vibration, heat, and light.  
- Hybrid optimization algorithms: PSO, DE, GA, PSO+DE, PSO+GA+DE.  
- Advanced smoothing with multi-level filtering for stable power output.  
- Adaptive weighting between efficiency and stability.  
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics: energy/cost ratio, stability, robustness, and computation time.  
- Unified benchmarking for fair comparison between algorithms.  

System Information
- Simulation includes nonlinear efficiency curves, dynamic solar angles, mechanical constraints, and environmental noise.  
- Support for multiple modules integrated in one system.  
- Adjustable parameters for optimization iterations and cost modeling.  
- Microcontroller-based control logic for realistic deployment.
